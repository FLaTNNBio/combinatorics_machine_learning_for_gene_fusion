GOAL:
1. to develop advanced ML-based strategies for the gene fusion identification exploiting the CW-based embeddings for biological sequences
2. to carry out experiments to assess the effectiveness of  model for classify reads as chimeric or not chimeric.
  
We define gene fusion as a chromosomal rearrangement that combines two genes into a single fusion gene, resulting in a chimeric transcript formed by the concatenation of segments from each of the original genes.


Our experiments is based on the files into the '''dataset''' folder organized ...
